# FTC Control System

The FTC Control System consists of two products: the Expansion Hubs and the Control Hubs. Control Hubs have historically been an older product, but beginning this year, FTC is releasing a new version of the Control Hubs. **This tutorial does not support the old nor the new Control Hubs.**

If you need to use FTC Control Hubs, follow this tutorial from STEMPump: [https://stempump.com/resources/course/page.php?course=FTC%20Programming&id=5](https://stempump.com/resources/course/page.php?course=FTC%20Programming&id=5)
