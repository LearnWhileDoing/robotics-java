# Hardware mapping

Hardware mapping allows your code to connect with your hardware. You will assign names to your motors and servos that will be referenced in your code.

You won't need to perform these steps until you are ready to begin programming and have plugged in all the necessary parts for your robot.

## Create a new configuration

Make sure that your phones are paired together and that your Robot Controller phone is properly connected to the Expansion Hub.

1. On the Driver Station phone, tap the menu in the top right-hand corner, and go to Configure Robot → New → Scan → Expansion Hub Portal 1. You should see two expansion hubs.
2. Make note of which ports your motors and servos are plugged into, and which Expansion Hub.

### To configure a motor

1. Determine which hub the motor is plugged into as well as the port number.
2. On the Driver Station phone, tap on the expansion hub the motor is connected to.
3. Choose "Motors".
4. Scroll down to the port to which the motor is connected.
5. Select the type of motor it is and give it a name.

If you disconnect a motor, you must change the motor type to "Nothing" in the configuration.

### To configure a servo

1. Determine which hub the servo is plugged into as well as the port number.
2. On the Driver Station phone, tap on the expansion hub the servo is connected to.
3. Choose "Servo".
4. Scroll down to the port to which the servo is connected.
5. Select the type of servo it is and give it a name.

If you disconnect a servo, you must change the servo type to "Nothing" in the configuration.
