# Using the FTC Project Folder

Each season, FTC provides an Android Studio Project Folder. This folder contains the Android app that you will install on your Robot Controller phone. The folder is available online on [Github](https://github.com).

## Download the folder

For the 2019-2020 Skystone season \(for which this tutorial was written\), the folder is available at [https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone).

## Importing the project to Android Studio

Open up Android Studio. It may ask you to perform additional setup -- follow the instructions on screen. You will then click on "Import project \(Eclipse, ADT, Gradle, etc.\)". From there, select the project folder on your computer. Android Studio will then begin to import the folder. This may take a couple of minutes. You will know it is finished when the loading text at the bottom of the screen goes away.

Once it has finished importing, your Android Studio should look similar to this:
