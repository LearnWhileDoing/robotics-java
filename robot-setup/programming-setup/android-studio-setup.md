## What is Android Studio?

> Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\) for Android app development, based on IntelliJ IDEA.

### Integrated Development Environment

Without getting too technical, it allows for developers like you and your team to write code for FTC or other Android apps without having to worry much about how your phone and your computer communicate.
