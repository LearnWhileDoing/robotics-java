## Testing Out Code

We recommend using repl.it to test code out. We've found it's the easiest way to get up and running, with minimal setup required. For many lessons, it will greatly improve your ability to comprehend the material if you try it out yourself. [Try it out now!](https://repl.it/languages/java10)
